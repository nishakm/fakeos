# FakeOS: Implementation and notes based on educational courses available online

## About the Author's Abilities
This is my first real foray into Operating Systems. It has been years since I programmed in DOS. I have been develping on a Linux based machine for years now and hence my current experience is the reference point I choose to learn something new. With that in mind, here is my reference should anyone else want to use it:

- Fedora VM and Ubuntu native install
- git and gcc installed on both

## Learning Material
FakeOS is based on the MIT online course on operating systems
This does not follow any of the lab implementations but it does use some material from the first lab
